# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
Chart the research of belly button biodiversity.

Using d3 to read the json file of data from the Belly 
Button Biodiversity research we were able to filter the data samples and break out the id's and values to chart and the lables for the samples. This allowed us to also create a dropdown box loaded with the data for users to view the values for the specemins of specific id numbers and chart that individuals outcomes. 

We populated the Demographic Info table with a default starting test subject in which users can see their chosen specimen side by side with the specemin info.

We also created a bubble chart showing the levels for different types of bacteria for that test subject.
